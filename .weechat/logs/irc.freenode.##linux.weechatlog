2020-12-02 00:39:57	hexnewbie	pjt_tmp: DOS command line was also nostalgically familiar, although going back to it without tab completion and a plethora of bash commands that have no equivalent can be frustrating.
2020-12-02 00:40:42	pjt_tmp	and yet today, ms comes back with powershell which ends up outdoing bash at times. weird how that happens.
2020-12-02 00:40:49	hexnewbie	But the rule was you almost didn't use the command line (except for writing scripts), you ran a file manager (like nc). Which is still why I default to mc most of the time, even if tab completion takes care of 60% of the need for it

2020-12-06 00:09:40	lortiz	From that pastebin, it looks more like you tried to install it by running 'sudo ./install.sh', that probably calls dpkg on some other .deb file, try finding the .deb file and use dpkg directly
2020-12-06 00:10:21	ayecee	lortiz: hard to tell. the narrative wanders over several different attempts and private thoughts and theories.
