2020-12-19 04:28:10	r3dux	batot: yes... they are stored to "~/.gitconfig" you can edit them there or by running the command you mentioned... it will need both the user name and the email.

2020-12-19 04:28:16	luna_	no really batot you should type your name and email in your git config but you can't directly configure
