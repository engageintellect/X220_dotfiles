2020-12-27 17:16:06	cads	As the project owner, I actually want full control over how my project builds, and I don't want to give my devs (ie, myself) any choice in the matter. Ie, I'm maintaining half a dozen projects, and I'm bugging out because I'm seeing a single line "poetry.toml" in each one. It needs to end. It needs to move into the main project config file. I'm not going to maintain an extra single line config file.
2020-12-27 17:16:56	grym	never heard of a poetry.toml
2020-12-27 17:16:57	grym	what's it do
